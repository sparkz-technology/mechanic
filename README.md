# Mechanic Project

## Overview
The Mechanic Project is a Node.js application designed to provide a robust backend server using Express.js. It incorporates several key features such as user authentication, data validation, and API documentation using Swagger.

## Features
- User authentication with JWT
- Data validation with Joi
- API documentation with Swagger
- Email services with Nodemailer
- Environment variable management with dotenv
- Logging with Morgan
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Primary programming language
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templates for server-side rendering

## Project Structure
- `server.js`: Main entry point of the application
- `configs`: Configuration files
- `src`: Source code (controllers, models, routes, etc.)
- `views`: EJS templates

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sparkz-technology/mechanic.git
   cd mechanic
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables as follows:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   For development mode:
   ```sh
